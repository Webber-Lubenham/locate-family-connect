1 - Only one level of indentation per method

2 - Never use else

3 - Encapsulate all primitive types and strings
(obsession with primitive types)
- Low code reuse
- Impossible to write unit tests
- Causes code duplication
- High coupling
- Primitive types have no behavior
- Impossibility of using DDD tactical modeling
(Value Objects)

4 - Wrap collections in classes

5 - Use only one dot per line (Law of Demeter)

6 - Do not abbreviate variable and method names

7 - Keep all classes small (max 50 lines)

8 - No class with more than two instance variables

never execute npm run dev without before see if this is already running
# 🧠 Development Guidelines for Locate-Family-Connect

*Updated: 2025-05-05*

---

## ⚙️ Git Command Automation
Always use:
```bash
git status
git add -A
git commit -m "your detailed message [type: fix/feature/docs]"
git push
```

---

## 👨‍💻 Your Role
You are a senior engineer focused on the Locate-Family-Connect system, which connects guardians and students through location sharing and secure notifications. Prioritize data security, authentication flow stability, and Edge Functions performance.

---

## 🏗️ Project Architecture and Stack
- **Frontend:** React + TypeScript + Vite
- **UI:** Custom components + Radix UI + TailwindCSS
- **Backend:** Supabase (PKCE Auth, PostgreSQL, Edge Functions)
- **Maps:** MapBox for location visualization and sharing
- **Emails:** Resend API (domain: sistema-monitore.com.br)
- **App:** SPA with profile-based authentication flow (guardian/student)

### Critical File Structure
- `/src/contexts/UnifiedAuthContext.tsx` – PKCE authentication management
- `/src/lib/supabase.ts` – Supabase Client instance and configuration
- `/src/App.tsx` – Routes protected by user type
- `/src/lib/db/migrations/` – SQL migrations with RLS policies and triggers
- `/supabase/functions/share-location/` – Edge Function for location sharing via email
- `/src/components/guardian/`, `/src/components/student/` – User profile-specific components
- `/scripts/` – Diagnostic scripts (test-resend.mjs, test-email.mjs, test-db-connection.js)
- `/docs/` – Technical documentation (configuracao-resend.md, edge-functions.md)

---

## 🧱 Structure and Organization
- Split large files into smaller modules (<300 lines).
- Separate authentication logic from business logic.
- Maintain consistency in folder structure by profile (`student/`, `guardian/`).
- Use well-defined RLS policies instead of frontend authorization logic.
- Implement all Edge Functions with detailed logs and error handling.
- Centralize external API configuration (Resend, MapBox) in dedicated files.
- Store sensitive data only in environment variables.

---

## 🌍 Environments and Configuration
- **Resend API:** ALWAYS use the updated key (check in `/docs/configuracao-resend.md`).
- **Edge Functions:** Update secret keys via Supabase CLI (never hardcoded).
- **Supabase:** Maintain consistency between local and production environments with `supabase link`.
- **Database:** Keep all migrations versioned and applied in order.
- **Indexes:** Maintain indexes for `guardians_student_id_idx`, `guardians_email_idx`, `idx_users_user_type`.
- **Transactions:** Use transactions for multiple operations (especially in user registration).
- **Diagnostics:** Regularly run the scripts `/scripts/test-resend.mjs` and `/scripts/conexao-supabase.mjs`.

---

## 🔁 Reuse & Consistency
- Reuse existing components for authentication flows.
- Maintain hook patterns in `src/hooks/` (e.g., `useStudentLocations`).
- Follow the existing type structure in `src/types/`.
- Use formatting and validation utilities in `src/lib/utils/`.
- Reuse existing style configurations instead of duplicating styles.
- Maintain consistency in database interaction via named SQL functions.

---

## 🧠 Planner Mode
1. Reflect on impacts to authentication flow and location sharing.
2. Review `UnifiedAuthContext.tsx`, Edge Functions, and related RLS policies.
3. Check implications for both profiles (guardian/student).
4. Ask questions about impact on Resend and MapBox integrations.
5. Check for potential conflicts with existing triggers and SQL functions.
6. Consider the impact on Row Level Security policies.
7. Propose a plan focusing on security and backwards compatibility.
8. Implement in stages, testing each profile separately.

---

## 🧪 Debugger Mode
1. Check issues in critical integrations:
   - Supabase Authentication (PKCE)
   - Emails via Resend (domain verification)
   - Edge Function `share-location`
   - RLS policies in `locations` and `guardians` tables
   - SQL triggers for `handle_new_user`
2. Check specific logs:
   - Supabase Auth Logs (`public.auth_logs`)
   - Edge Function `share-location` logs
   - Resend API responses
   - Supabase Client errors
3. Use diagnostic scripts:
   - `/scripts/test-resend.mjs`
   - `/scripts/test-email.mjs`
   - `/scripts/conexao-supabase.mjs`
4. Verify API key consistency (especially Resend).
5. Test complete authentication and sharing flows.
6. Verify database structure integrity with migrations.

---

## 🧩 Dev Experience
- Prioritize authentication flow and password recovery (critical).
- Start by testing with users of both profiles (student/guardian).
- Verify Edge Function `share-location` functionality.
- Validate profile synchronization via the `handle_new_user` trigger.
- Test email notifications with the verified domain.
- Ensure RLS policies are working correctly.
- Document any changes to critical files.

---

## 🗣️ Interaction
- Clearly communicate issues in authentication flow or sharing.
- Show visual examples of emails sent by the application.
- Use flowcharts to explain guardian-student relationships.
- Provide detailed logs when reporting errors.
- Document domain configuration steps in Resend.
- Keep documentation updated about API keys and secrets.

---

## 🔍 Project Vision
Always clarify:
- Expected behavior of real-time location updates
- Format and content of sharing emails
- Expected password recovery flow for each profile
- Dashboard behavior specific to each user type
- Expected permissions between guardians and students
- Integrations with external services (Resend, MapBox)

---

## 🔐 Security
- **Emails:** ONLY use the verified domain `sistema-monitore.com.br` with Resend.
- **API Keys:** Maintain consistency with the main Resend API key.
- **Auth:** Correctly implement the Supabase PKCE flow.
- **RLS:** Maintain policies for all tables (`locations`, `profiles`, `guardians`).
- **Edge Functions:** Implement JWT token validation and rate limiting.
- **Database:** Always use transactions and SQL functions with SECURITY DEFINER.
- **Triggers:** Maintain the `handle_new_user()` trigger for profile synchronization.
- **Logs:** Use the `auth_logs` table for auditing and diagnostics.

---

## 🛡️ Specific Vulnerabilities
- Password recovery flow failures
- Inconsistency in Resend API keys
- Domain verification for email sending
- RLS policies bypass in location tables
- Profile synchronization trigger failures
- Unauthorized access to shared locations
- Rate limiting issues in Edge Functions

---

## 🧪 Tests and Validation
- **Auth:** Complete PKCE flow testing for both profiles.
- **Emails:** Validate sending with `test-resend.mjs` and `test-email.mjs`.
- **Database:** Check integrity with diagnostic scripts.
- **Edge Functions:** Test `share-location` with Supabase CLI.
- **RLS:** Validate policies for different user profiles.
- **Critical flows:** Password recovery, location sharing.
- **Integrations:** Supabase Auth, MapBox, Resend.
