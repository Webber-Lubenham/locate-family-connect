Instructions to generate an SSH key and add it to your GitHub account:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Generate a new SSH key pair by running:
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
   (If your system does not support ed25519, use rsa:
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com")

3. When prompted to "Enter a file in which to save the key," press Enter to accept the default location.

4. Enter a secure passphrase when prompted (optional but recommended).

5. After generation, start the ssh-agent in the background:
   - On Linux/macOS:
     eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
   - On Windows (Git Bash):
     eval $(ssh-agent -s)

6. Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent:
   ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
   (or id_rsa if you used rsa)

7. Copy the SSH public key to your clipboard:
   - On Linux/macOS:
     cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub | pbcopy
   - On Windows (Git Bash):
     clip < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
   - Or open the file ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub with a text editor and copy manually.

8. Go to your GitHub account settings:
   https://github.com/settings/keys

9. Click "New SSH key," give it a title (e.g., "My Laptop"), and paste the copied key into the "Key" field.

10. Click "Add SSH key" to save.

11. Test your SSH connection with:
    ssh -T git@github.com

12. If successful, you can now push to your GitHub repositories using SSH.
